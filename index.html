My initial idea was studying medicine, however I only recently realised how fascinating computers are and how they helped me during my years as a teenager!  My goal during this year of studies is to be able to master <strong>HTML, CSS and JavaScript</strong> as well as gaining the knowledge necessary to master softwares such as <strong>Git</strong> and the OS <strong>Linux</strong>.</p>
<p>Outside the university, I am a gamer that loves playing video games from different genres. I am also a huge fan of the football team <strong>Real Madrid</strong>, I have seen them win various trophies, creating the best memories for me and many fans around the globe!</p>
<p>I am looking for opportunities that can help me gain knowledge, as well as creating projects that can be helpful for the people around the world. If you are interested, feel free to contact me via e-mail! </p>
