<p>My initial idea was studying medicine, however I only recently realised how fascinating computers are and how theyhelped me during my years as a teenager!</p>
<p>My goal during this year of studies is to be able to master <strong>HTML, CSS and JavaScript</strong> as well as gaining the knowledge necessary to master softwares such as <strong>Git</strong> and the OS <strong>Linux</strong></p>
<p>Outside the university, I am a gamer that loves playing video games from different genres</p>
